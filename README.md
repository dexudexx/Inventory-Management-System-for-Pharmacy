# Inventory Management System (IMS) for Pharmacies

Welcome to the **Inventory Management System (IMS)**, a free and open-source project designed specifically for pharmacies. This tool is built to simplify inventory tracking, optimize stock management, and improve overall efficiency in day-to-day operations.

- **Stock Management**  
  Monitor stock levels with precise deductions based on sales, ensuring the correct batch and medicine combination is updated.  

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Designed with simplicity in mind to make it accessible for everyone, from pharmacy owners to employees.
